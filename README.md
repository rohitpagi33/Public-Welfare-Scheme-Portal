# Public Welfare Scheme Portal - Indus Hackathon 2025

## Overview
The **Public Welfare Scheme Portal** is designed to streamline and enhance the distribution of government benefits to citizens. This platform ensures secure authentication, seamless document verification, and real-time updates, making welfare distribution more transparent, efficient, and user-friendly. By leveraging automation and secure transactions, the system minimizes fraud and ensures that assistance reaches the right beneficiaries.

### 3. **Aadhar-Based Authentication with OTP Verification**
   - Users authenticate via their Aadhar number.
   - Secure OTP verification ensures safe access to the portal.

### 4. **SMS & Real-Time Notifications**
   - Citizens receive SMS updates about their application status using Twilio.
   - Admins can send alerts about new schemes and important announcements.
   - Real-time notifications within the platform keep users informed of their application progress.

### 5. **Dynamic Welfare Scheme Management**
   - Admins can create, manage, and modify welfare schemes dynamically.
   - Eligibility criteria are automatically determined based on uploaded documents.

### 6. **Secure & Controlled Document Upload**
